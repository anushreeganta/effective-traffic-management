# effective-traffic-management
In todayâ€™s scenario traffic congestion is a severe problem in many major cities across the world and has become nightmare for commuters. One efficent solution is through image processing.
Requirements: Matlab R2016a or R2017a software

Step 1: Open the file Traffic.m using Matlab.
Step 2: Set the path to the folder where the traffic.mp4 video is copied in your system.
Step 3: Then, run the code.
Step 4: Wait for sometime until the code runs.
Step 5: Play the video.

Note: It takes some time to run the video since the video which we are reding is of big size, 
      if we read a pic then the time taken to run the code will be of few seconds.
